Scenario Overview-
You work for a company that tracks sales performance across regions. The data resides in:

Excel File 1: Sales Transactions

Contains details of individual transactions.
Columns: Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Product ID, Quantity Sold, Sales Amount.

Excel File 2: Product Information

Contains product details.
Columns: Product ID, Product Name, Category, Price.

Azure SQL Server: Customer Information

Contains customer demographics.
Columns: Customer ID, Customer Name, Region, Segment.

Your goal is to create a Tableau dashboard to analyze sales performance by person (Customer Name) and product (Product Name), with filtering options for Region, Product Category, and Date Range.

Step 1: Connect Data Sources in Tableau

> Connect Excel Files:

Open Tableau Desktop.
Click on Connect > Microsoft Excel.

Load Excel File 1: Sales Transactions.

Repeat for Excel File 2: Product Information.

> Connect Azure SQL Server:

Click on Connect > Microsoft SQL Server.
Enter your server name, database name, username, and password to connect.
Select the Customer Information table.


Step 2: Create Relationships Between Datasets

Join Excel Files:

Drag Sales Transactions and Product Information to the canvas.
Create a relationship (Join) between Product ID in both tables.

Join Condition: Sales Transactions.Product ID = Product Information.Product ID.

Relate SQL Server Data:

Drag the Customer Information table to the canvas.

Create a relationship (Join) between Customer ID in Sales Transactions and Customer ID in Customer Information.

Join Condition: Sales Transactions.Customer ID = Customer Information.Customer ID.


Step 3: Create Individual Sheets

Sheet 1: Total Sales by Customer Name

Drag Customer Name to Rows.
Drag Sales Amount to Columns.
Add a filter for Region from the Customer Information table.
Sort customers by sales in descending order.
Rename the sheet to Sales by Customer.


Sheet 2: Sales by Product

Drag Product Name to Rows.
Drag Sales Amount to Columns.
Add a filter for Category from the Product Information table.
Add color coding by Category for better visualization.
Rename the sheet to Sales by Product.


Sheet 3: Sales Trend Over Time

Drag Date to Columns.
Drag Sales Amount to Rows.
Add a filter for Region.
Use a line chart to show trends.
Rename the sheet to Sales Trend.


Sheet 4: Sales Quantity by Product and Region


Drag Product Name to Rows.
Drag Quantity Sold to Columns.
Add Region to Filters and Category to Color.
Use a bar chart to show quantities.
Rename the sheet to Sales Quantity.


Step 4: Build the Dashboard

Create Dashboard:

Click on Dashboard > New Dashboard.
Drag all four sheets into the dashboard.

Arrange them in a grid format with Sales by Customer and Sales by Product on top, and Sales Trend and Sales Quantity below.

>> Use as a filter option for all the sheets in Dashboard...

Add Titles and Descriptions:

Add meaningful titles and a short description for the dashboard.

Customize for Better UX:

Use tooltips to show additional details like Price, Segment, and Quantity Sold.


Step 5: Test and Publish

Test filtering by:

> Selecting a specific customer.
> Filtering by product category or date range.
> Ensuring all sheets update correctly.

Publish the dashboard to Tableau Server or Tableau Online for sharing.
